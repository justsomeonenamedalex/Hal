"PART I
AFRICA
3,000,000 YEARS AGO"

VIEWS OF AFRICAN DRYLANDS – DROUGHT
The remorseless drought had lasted now for ten million years, and
would not end for another million. The reign of the terrible
lizards had long since passed, but here on the continent which
would one day be known as Africa, the battle for survival had
reached a new climax of ferocity, and the victor was not yet in
sight. In this dry and barren land, only the small or the swift or
the fierce could flourish, or even hope to exist.

INT. / EXT. CAVES – MOONWATCHER
The man-apes of the field had none of these attributes, and they
were on the long, pathetic road to racial extinction. About twenty
of them occupied a group of caves overlooking a small, parched
valley, divided by a sluggish, brown stream.
The tribe had always been hungry, and now it was starving. As the
first dim glow of dawn creeps into the cave, Moonwatcher discovers
that his father has died during the night. He did not know the Old
One was his father, for such a relationship was beyond his
understanding. but as he stands looking down at the emaciated body
he feels something, something akin to sadness. Then he carries his
dead father out of the cave, and leaves him for the hyenas.
Among his kind, Moonwatcher is almost a giant. He is nearly five
feet high, and though badly undernourished, weighs over a hundred
pounds. His hairy, muscular body is quite man-like, and his head
is already nearer man than ape. The forehead is low, and there are
great ridges over the eye-sockets, yet he unmistakably holds in
his genes the promise of humanity. As he looks out now upon the
hostile world, there is alreadysomething in his gaze beyond the
grasp of any ape. In those dark, deep-set eyes is a dawning
awareness-the first intimations of an intelligence which would not
fulfill itself for another two million years.

EXT. THE STREAM – THE OTHERS
As the dawn sky brightens, Moonwatcher and his tribe reach the
shallow stream.
The Others are already there. They were there on the other side
every day – that did not make it any less annoying.
There are eighteen of them, and it is impossible to distinguish
them from the members of Moonwatcher's own tribe. As they see him
coming, the Others begin to angrily dance and shriek on their side
of the stream, and his own people reply In kind.
The confrontation lasts a few minutes – then the display dies out
as quickly as it has begun, and everyone drinks his fill of the

muddy water. Honor has been satisfied – each group has staked its
claim to its own territory.

EXT. AFRICAN PLAIN – HERBIVORES
Moonwatcher and his companions search for berries, fruit and
leaves, and fight off pangs of hunger, while all around them,
competing with them for the samr fodder, is a potential source of
more food than they could ever hope to eat. Yet all the thousands
of tons of meat roaming over the parched savanna and through the
brush is not only beyond their reach; the idea of eating it is
beyond their imagination. They are slowly starving to death in the
midst of plenty.

EXT. PARCHED COUNTRYSIDE – THE LION
The tribe slowly wanders across the bare, flat countryside
foraging for roots and occasional berries.
Eight of them are irregularly strung out on the open plain, about
fifty feet apart.
The ground is flat for miles around.
Suddenly, Moonwatcher becomes aware of a lion, stalking them about
300 yards away.
Defenceless and with nowhere to hide, they scatter in all
directions, but the lion brings one to the ground.

EXT. DEAD TREE – FINDS HONEY
It had not been a good day, though as Moonwatcher had no real
remembrance of the past he could not compare one day with another.
But on the way back to the caves he finds a hive of bees in the
stump of a dead tree, and so enjoys the finest delicacy his people
could ever know. Of course, he also collects a good many stings,
but he scacely notices them. He is now as near to contentment as
he is ever likely to be; for thought he is still hungry, he is not
actually weak with hunger. That was the most that any hominid
could hope for.

INT. / EXT. CAVES – NIGHT TERRORS
Over the valley, a full moon rises, and a cold wind blows down
from the distant mountains. It would be very cold tonight – but
cold, like hunger, was not a matter for any real concern; it was
merely part of the background of life.
This Little Sun, that only shone at night and gave no warmth, was
dangerous; there would be enemies abroad. Moonwatcher crawls out
of the cave, clambers on to a large boulder besides the entrance,
and squats there where he can survey the valley. If any hunting
beast approached, he would have time to get back to the relative
safety of the cave.

Of all the creatures who had ever lived on Earth, Moonwatcher's
race was the first to raise their eyes with . INTerest to the
Moon, and though he could not remember it, when he was young,
Moonwatcher would reach out and try to touch its ghostly face. Now
he new he would have to find a tree that was high enough.
He stirs when shrieks and screams echo up the slope from one of
the lower caves, and he does not need to hear theo occasional
growl of the lion to know what is happening. Down there in the
darkness, old One-Eye and his family are dying, and the thought
that he might help in some way never crosses Moonwatcher's mind.
The harsh logic of survival rules out such fancies. Every cave is
silent, lest it attract disaster.
And in the caves, in tortured spells of fitful dozing and fearful
waiting, were gathered the nightmares of generations
yet to come.

EXT. THE STREAM – INVASION
The Others are growing desperate; the forage on their side of the
valley is almost exhausted. Perhaps they realise that
Moonwatcher's tribe has lost three of its numbers during the
night, for they choose this mourning to break the truce. When they
meet at the river in the still, misty dawn, there is a deeper and
more menacing note in their challenge. The noisy but usually
harmless confrontation lasts only a few seconds before the
invasion begins.
In an uncertainly-moving horde, the Others cross the river,
shieking threats and hunched for the attack. They are led by a
big-toothed hominid of Moonwatcher's own size and age.
Startled and frightened, the tribe retreats before the first
advance, throwing nothing more substantial than imprecations at
the invaders. Moonwatcher moves with them, his mind a mist of rage
and confusion. To be driven from their own territory is a great
badness, but to lose the river is death. He does not know what to
do; it is a situation beyond his experience.
Then he becomes dimly aware that the Others are slowing down, and
advancing with obvious reluctance. The further they move from
their own side, the more uncertain and unhappy they become. Only
Big-Tooth still retains any of his original drive, and he is
rapidly being seperated from his followers.
As he sees this, Moonwatcher's own morale immediately revives. He
slows down his retreat, and begins to make
reassuring noises to his companions. Novel sensations fill his dim
mind – the first faint precursors of bravery and leadership.
Before he realizes it, he is face to face with Big-Tooth, and the
two tribes come to a halt many paces away.
The disorganized and unscientific conflict could have ended
quickly if either had used his fist as a club, but this
innovation still lay hundreds of thousands of years in the future.
Instead, the slowly weakening fighters claw and
scratch and try to bite each other.

Rolling over and over, they come to a patch of stony ground, and
when they reach it Moonwatcher is on top. By chance, he chooses
this moment to grab the hair on Big-Tooth's scalp, and bang his
head on the ground. The resulting CRACK is so satisfactory, and
produces such an immediate weakening in Big-Tooth's resistance,
that he quickly repeats it.
Even when Big-Tooth ceases to move for some time, Moonwatcher
keeps up the exhilirating game.
With shrieks of panic, the Others retreat back, across the stream.
The defenders cautiously pursue them as far as the water's edge.

EXT. CAVE – NEW SOUND
Dozing fitfully and weakened by his stuggle, Moonwatcher is
startled by a sound.
He sits up in the fetid darkness of the cave, straining his senses
out into the night, and fear creeps slowly into his soul. Never in
his life – already twice as long as most members of his species
could expect – has he heard a sound like this. The great cats
approached in silence, and the only thing that betrayed them was a
rare slide of earth, or the occasional cracking of a twig. Yet
this is a continuing crunching noise that grows steadily louder.
It seemed that some enormous beast was moving through the night,
making no attempt at concealment, and ignoring all obstacles.
And then there came a sound which Moonwatcher could not possibly
have identified, for it had never been heard before in the history
of this planet.

EXT. CAVE – NEW ROCK
Moonwatcher comes face to face with the New Rock when he leads the
tribe down to the river in the first light of morning. He had
almost forgotten the terror of the night, because nothing had
happened after that initial noise, so he does not even associate
this strange thing with danger or with fear. There is nothing in
the least alarming about it.
It is a cube about fifteen feet on a side, and it is made of some
completely transparent material; indeed, it is not easy
to see except when the light of the sun glints on its edges. There
are no natural objects to which Moonwatcher can
compare this apparition. Though he is wisely cautious of most new
things, he does not hesitate to walk up to it. As nothing happens,
he puts out his hand, and feels a warm, hard surface.
After several minutes of intense thought, he arrives at a
brilliant explanation. It is a rock, of course, and it must have
grown during the night. There are many plants that do this –
white, pulpy things shaped like pebbles, that seem to shoot up in
the hours of darkness. It is true that they are small and round,
whereas this is large and square; but greater and later
philosophers than Moonwatcher would be prepared to overlook
equally striking exceptions to their laws.

This really superb piece of abstract thinking leads Moonwatcher to
a deduction which he immediately puts to the test. The white,
round pebble-plants are very tasty (though there were a few that
made one violently sick); perhaps this square one...?
A few licks and attempted nibbles quickly disillusion him. There
is no nourishment here; so like a sensible hominid, he continues
on his way to the river and forgets all about the Cube.

EXT. CUBE – FIRST LESSON
They are still a hundred yards from the New Rock when the sound
begins.
It is quite soft, and it stops them in their tracks, so that they
stand paralyzed on the trail with their jaws hanging. A simple,
maddeningly repetitious rhythm pulses out of the crystal cube and
hypnotises all who come within its spell. For the first time – and
the last, for two million year – the sound of drumming is heard in
Africa.
The throbbing grows louder, more insistent. Presently the hominids
begin to move forward like sleep-walkers, towards the source of
that magnetic sound. Sometimes they take little dancing steps, as
their blood responds to the rhythms that their descendants will
not create for ages yet.
Totally entranced, they gather around the Cube, forgetting the
hardships of the day, the perils of the approaching dusk, and the
hunger in their bellies.
Now, spinning wheels of light begin to merge, and the spokes fuse
into luminous bars that slowly recede into the distance, rotating
on their axes as they do; and the hominids watch, wideeyed,
mesmerized captives of the Crystal Cube.
Then by some magic – though it was no more magical than all that
had gone on before – a perfectly normal scene appears. It is as if
a cubical block had been carved out of the day and shifted into
the night. Inside that block is a group of four hominids, who
might have been members of Moonwatcher's own tribe, eating chunks
of meat. The carcass of a wart-hog lies near them.
This little family of male and female and two children is gorged
and replete, with sleek and glossy pelts – and this was a
condition of life that Moonwatcher had never imagined. From time
to time they stir lazily, as they loll at ease near the entrance
of their cave, apparently at peace with the world. The spectacle
of domestic bliss merges into a totally different scene.
The family is no longer reposing peacefully outside its cave; it
is foraging, searching for food like any normal hominids.
A small wart-hog ambles past the group of browsing humanoids
without giving them more than a glance, for they had never been
the slightest danger to its species.
But that happy state of affairs is about to end. The big male
suddenly bends down, picks up a heavy stone lying at his feet –

and hurls it upon the unfortunate pig. The stone descends upon its
skull, making exactly the same noise that Moonwatcher had produced
in his now almost forgotten encounter with Big-Tooth. And the
result, too, is much the same – the warthog gives one amazed,
indignant squeal, and collapses in a motionless heap.
Then the whole sequence begins again, but this time it unfolds
itself with incredible slowness. Every detail of the movement can
be followed; the stone arches leisurely through the air, the pig
crumples up and sinks to the ground. There the scene freezes for
long moments, the slayer standing motionless above the slain, the
first of all weapons in his hand.
The scene suddenly fades out. The cube is no more than a
glimmering outline in the darkness; the hominids stir, as if
awakening from a dream, realise where they are, and scuttle back
to their caves.
They have no concious memory of what they had seen; but that
night, as he sits brooding at the entrance of his lair, his ears
attuned to the noises of the world around him, Moonwatcher feels
the first faint. twinges of a new and potent emotion – the urge to
kill. He had taken his first step towards humanity.

EXT. CAVE AND PLAINS – UTOPIA
Babies were born and sometimes lived; feeble, toothless thirtyyear-olds died; the lion took its toll in the night; the Others
threatened daily across the river – and the trib prospered. In the
course of a single year, Moonwatcher and his companions had
changed almost beyond recognition.
They had become as plump as the family in the Cave, who no longer
haunted their dreams. They had learned their lessons well; now
they could handle all the stone tools and weapons that the Cube
had revealed to them.
They were no longer half-numbed with starvation, and they had time
both for leisure and for the first rudiments of thought. Their new
way of life was casually accepted, and they did not associate it
in any way with the crystal cube still standing outside their
cave.
But no Utopia is perfect, and this one had two blemishes. The
first was the marauding lion, whose passion for hominids seemed to
have grown even stronger now that they were better nourished. The
second was the tribe across the river; for somehow the Others had
survived, and had stubbornly refused to die of starvation.

EXT. CAVES – KILLING THE LION
With the partly devoured carcass of a warthog laid out on the
ground at the point. he hope the boulder would impact, Moonwatcher
and three of his bravest companions wait for two consecutive
nights. On the third the lion comes, betraying his presences by a
small pebble slide.

When they can here the lion below, softly tearing at the meat,
they strain themselves against the massive boulder. The sound of
the lion stops; he is listening. Again they silently heave against
the enormous stone, exerting the final limits of their strength.
The rock begin to tip to a new balance point..
The lion twitches alert to this sound, but having no fear of these
creatures, he makes the first of two mistakes which will cost him
his life; he goes back to his meal.
The rock moves slowly over the ledge, picking up speed with
amazing suddeness. It strikes a projection in the cliff about
fifteen feet above the ground, which deflects its path outward.
Just at this instant, the lion reacts instinctively and leaps away
from the face of the cliff directly into the path of the
onrushing boulder. He has combined the errors of overconfidence
and bad luck.
The next morning they find the lion in front of the cave. They
also find one of their tribe who had incautiously peeped out to
see what was happening, and was apparently killed by a small rock
torn loose by the boulder; but this was a small price to pay for
such a great victory.
And then one night the crystal cube was gone, and not even
Moonwatcher ever thought of it again. He was still wholly unaware
of all that it had done.

EXT. STREAM – MASTER OF THE WORLD
From their side of the stream, in the never violated safety of
their own territory, the Others see Moonwatcher and fourteen males
of his tribe appear from behind a small hillock over-looking the
stream, silhouetted against the dawn sky.
The Others begin to scream their daily challenge. But today
something is different, though the Others do not immediatly
recognize this fact.
Instead of joining the verbal onslaught, as they had always done,
Moonwatcher and his small band decended from the rise, and begin
to move forward to the stream with a quiet purposefulness never
befor seen.
As the Others watch the figures silently approaching in the
morning mist, they become aware of the terrible strangness of this
encounter, and their rage gradually subsides down to an uneasy
silence.
At the water's edge, Moonwatcher and his band stop. They carry
their bone clubs and bone knives. Led by One-ear, the Others halfheartly resume the battle- chant. But they are suddenly confrunted
with a vision that cuts the sound from their throats, and strikes
terror into their hearts.

Moonwatcher, who had been partly concealed by two males who walked
before him, thrusts his arm high into the air. In his hand he
holds a stoud tree branch. Mounted atop the branch is the bloody
head of the lion, its mouth jammed open with a stick, displaying
its frightful fangs.
The Others gape in fearful disbelief at this display of power.
Moonwatchers stands motionless, thrusting the lion's head high.
Then with majestic deliberation, still carrying his mangled
standard above his head, he begins to cross the stream, followed
by his band.
The Others fade back from the stream, seeming to lack even the
ability to flee.
Moonwatcher steps ashore and walks to One-Ear, who stands unsurely
in front of his band.
Though he is a veteran of numerous combats at the water's edge,
One-Ear has never been attacked by an enemy who had not first
displayed his fighting rage; and he had never before been attacked
with a weapon. One-Ear, merely looks up at the raised club until
the heavey thigh bone of an antelope brings the darkness down
around him.

The Others stare in wonder at Moonwatcher's power.
Moonwatcher surveys the scene. Now he was master of the world, and
he was not sure what to do next... But he would think of
something.

TITLE CARD:
"PART II
YEAR 2001"

EARTH FROM 200 MILES UP
NARRATOR
By the year 2001, overpopulation has
replaced the problem of starvation, but
this was ominously offset by the absolute
and utter perfection of the weapon.
Hundreds of giant bombs had been placed in
perpetual orbit above the Earth. They were
capable of incinerating the entire Earth's
surface from an altitude of 100 miles.

FRENCH BOMB NARRATOR
Matters were further complicated by the
presence of twenty-seven nations in the
nuclear club. There had been no deliberate
or accidental use of nuclear weapons since
World War II and some people felt secure
in this knowledge. But to others, the
situation seemed comparible to an airline
with a perfect safety record; in showed
admirable care and skill but no one
expected it to last forever.

SPACE STATTION 5 – LOUNGE
FLOYD
Well, how nice to see you again, Elena.
You're looking wonderful.
ELENA
How nice to see you, Hyewood. This is my
good friend, Dr. HeywoodFLOYD. I'd like
you to meet Andre Smyslov...
Smyslov and the two other Russian women stand up and smile.
They shake hands after introduction and ad-lib "Hellos".
ELENA
And this is Dr. Kalinan... Stretyneva...
The Russians are very warm and friendly.
SMYSLOV
Dr. Floyd, won't you join us for a drink?
FLOYD
I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes,
but I'd love to.
There is a bit of confusion as all realize there is not enough
room for another person at the table. Smyslov offers Floyd his
chair and borrows another from a nearby table.
SYMYSLOV
What would you like to drink?

FLOYD
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink.
If it's all right I'll just sit for a
minute and then I've got to be off.
SMYSLOV
Are you quite sure?
FLOYD
Yes, really, thank you very much.
ELENA
Well... How's your lovely wife?
FLOYD
She's wonderful.
ELENA
And your charming little daughter?
FLOYD
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a
matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
ELENA
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
FLOYD
How is gregor?
ELENA
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a
chance to see each other very much these
days.
Polite laughter.
FLOYD
Well, where are all of you off to?
ELENA
Actually, we're on our way back from the
moon. We've just spent three months
calibrating the new antenna at Tchalinko.
And what about you?
FLOYD
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to
the moon
SMYSLOV
Are you, by any chance, going up to your
base at Clavius?
FLOYD
Yes, as a matter of fact, I am.
The Russians exchange significant glances.

FLOYD
Is there any particular reason why you
ask?
SMYSLOV
(pleasantly)
Well, Dr. Floyd, I hope that you don't
think I'm too inquisitive, but perhaps you
can clear up the mystery about what's been
going on up there.
FLOYD
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what
you mean.
SMYSLOV
Well, it's just for the past two weeks
there have been some extremely odd things
happening at Clavius.
FLOYD
Really?
SMYSLOV
Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you
phone the base, all you can get is a
recording which repeats that the phone
lines are temporarily out of order.
FLOYD
Well, I suppose they've been having a bit
of trouble with some of the equipment.
SMYSLOV
Yes, well at first we thought that was the
explanation, but it's been going on for
the past ten days.
FLOYD
You mean you haven't been able to get
anyone at the base for ten days?
SMYSLOV
That's right.
FLOYD
I see.
ELENA
Another thing, Heywood, two days ago, one
of our rocket buses was denied permission
for an emergency landing at Clavius.
FLOYD
How did they manage to do that without any
communication?
ELENA
Clavius Control came on the air just long
enough to transmit their refusal.

FLOYD
Well, that does sound very odd.
SMYSLOV
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a
bit of a row about it. Denying the men
permission to land was a direct violation
of the I.A.S. convention.
FLOYD
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back
safely.
SMYSLOV
Fortunately, they did.
FLOYD
Well, I'm glad about that.
The Russians exchange more glances. One of the Women offers around
a pill box. Elena and another Russian take one and the third
Russian declines.
SMYSLOV
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on
a point. you seem reticent to discuss, may
I ask you a straightforward question?
FLOYD
Certainly.
SMYSLOV
Quite frankly, we have had some very
reliable intelligence reports that a quite
serious epidemic has broken out at
Clavius. Something, apperently, of an
unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has
happened?
A long, awkward pause.
FLOYD
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not
at liberty to discuss this.
SMYSLOV
This epidemic could easily spread to our
base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all
the facts.
Long pause.
FLOYD
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to
discuss this.
ELENA
Are you sure you won't change your mind
about a drink?

FLOYD
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I
really must be going.
ELENA
Well, I hope that you and your wife can
come to the I.A.C. conference in June.
FLOYD
We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
ELENA
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to
seeing you.
FLOYD
Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to
meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
The Russians all rise and there are ad-libs of courtesy.
Floyd shakes hands and exits.
The Russians exchange a few serious paragraphes in Russian.

ARIES-IB IN SPACE
Earth much smaller than as seen from space station.
NARRATOR
The Aries-IB has become the standard
Space-Station-to-Lunar surface vehicle. It
was powered by low-thrust plasma jets
which would continue the mild acceleration
for fifteen minutes. Then the ship would
break the bonds of gravity and be a free
and independent planet, circling the Sun
in an orbit of its own.

ARIES PASSENGER AREA
Floyd is asleep, strtched out in the chair, covered with blankets
which are held secure by straps.
A Stewardess sits at the other side of the cabin, watching a
karate exhibition between two women on TV.
The elevator entrance door opens and the second Stewardess enters
carrying a tray of food.
She brings it to the other Stewardess.
STEWARDESS #1
Oh, thank you very much.
STEWARDESS #2
I see he's still asleep.

STEWARDESS #1
Yes. He hasn't moved since we left.
Stewardess #2 exits into elevator.

ARIES GALLEY AREA
Stewardess exits from elevator, goes to the kitchen section,
removes two trays, walks up to the side of the wall and enters
Pilot's compartment.

ARIES-IB COCKPIT
Pilot, Co-Pilot.
Stewardess enters, carrying food.
PILOT
Oh, thank you very much.
CO-PILOT
Thank you.
Stewardess smiles.
PILOT
(sighs)
Well, how's it going back there?
STEWARDESS
Fine. Very quiet. He's been asleep since
we left.
PILOT
Well, no one can say that he's not
enjoying the wonders of Space.
CO-PILOT
Well, whatever's going on up there, he's
going to arrive fresh and ready to go.
PILOT
I wonder what really is going on up there?

CO-PILOT
Well, I've heard more and more people talk
of an epidemic.
PILOT
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or
later.
CO-PILOT
Berkeley told me that they think it came
from contamination on a returning Mars
flight.

PILOT
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're
certainly not fooling around. This is the
first flight they allowed in for more than
a week.
CO-PILOT
I was working out what this trip must
cost, taking him up there by himself and
coming back empty.
PILOT
I'll bet it's a fortune.
CO-PILOT
Well, at ten thousand dollars a ticket, it
comes to the better part of six hundred
thousand dollars.
PILOT
Well, as soon as he wakes up, I'm going to
go back and talk to him. I must say, I'd
like to find out what's going on.

ARIES-IB IN SPACE
Moon very large.

ARIES-IB PASSENGER AREA
Floyd finishing breakfast.
Pilot enters.
PILOT
Well, good afternoon, Dr. Floyd. Did you
have a good rest?
FLOYD
Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep
I've had for the past two days.
PILOT
There's nothing like weightless sleep for
a complete rest.
FLOYD
When do we arrive at Clavius?
PILOT
We're scheduled to dock in about seven
hours. Is there anything we can do for
you?
FLOYD
Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have
taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.

PILOT
Well, if there is anything that you wnat,
just give a holler.
FLOYD
Thank you.
PILOT
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can
have a word with you about the security
arrangements?
FLOYD
What do you mean?
PILOT
Well... the crew is confined to the ship
when we land at Clavius. We have to stay
inside for the time it take to refit –
about twenty-four hours. And then we're
going to back empty.
FLOYD
I see.
PILOT
I take it this is something to do with the
trouble they're having up at Clavius?
FLOYD
I'm afraid that's out of my department,
Captain.
PILOT
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see,
I've got a girl who works in the Auditing
Department of the Territorial
Administrator and I haven't been able to
get her on the phone for the past week or
so, and with all these stories one hears,
I'm a little concerned about her.
FLOYD
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I
wouldn't think there's any cause for
alarm.
PILOT
Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too
concerned about it, except I've heard
these stories about the epidemic and, as a
matter of fact, I've heard that ten people
have died already.
FLOYD
I wish I could be more helpful, Captain,
but as I've said, I don't think there's
any cause for alarm.

PILOT
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and
I hope you don't mind me asking?
FLOYD
No, of course, Captain, I can understand
your concern.
PILOT
Well, thank you very much, and please let
us know if there is anything we can do to
make your trip more comfortable.

ARIES-IB CLOSER TO MOON
Floyd goes to Aries-IB washroom and looks at the very long list of
complicated instructions.

ARIES-IB CLOSER TO MOON
DISSOLVE TO:

FLOYD VISITING ARIES-IB COCKPIT
Weightless trick entrance.

ARIES-IB ORBITING MOON
NARRATOR
The laws of Earthly aesthetics did not
apply here, this world had been shaped and
molded by other than terrestrial forces,
operating over aeons of time unknown to
the young, verdant Earth, with its
fleeting Ice-Ages, its swiftly rising and
falling seas, its mountain ranges
dissolving like mists before the dawn.
Here was age inconceivable – but not
death, for the Moon had never lived until
now.

ARIES-IB COCKPIT
The crew and docking control people on the moon go through their
docking routine. This has the ritualistic tone and cadence of
present-day jet landing procedure. We only hear docking control.

ARIES-IB DECENDING
See air-view of base.

NARRATOR
The Base at Clavius was the first American
Lunar Settlement that could, in an
emergency, be entirely self-supporting.
NARRATOR
Water and all the necessities of life for
its eleven hundred men, women and children
were produced from the Lunar rocks, after
they had been crushed, heated and
chemically processed.
A ground bus nuzzles up to coupling section of Aries-IB.

INSIDE GREAT AIRLOCK ENTRANCE
Ground bus pulls in. Giant doors close behind it.

INSIDE SECOND AIRLOCK
Doors open after outside section doors are closed. Ground bus
pulls in. See people waiting for second airlock doors to close.

LOW GRAVITY GYMNASIUM TRICK WITH CHILDREN

NARRATOR
One of the attractions of life on the Moon
was undoubtedly the low gravity which
produced a sense of general well-being.

CHILDREN IN SCHOOL
Teacher showing Children views of Earth and map of Earth.
NARRATOR
The personnel of the Base and their
children were the forerunners of new
nations, new cultures that would
ultimately spread out across the solar
system. They no longer thought of Earth as
home. The time was fast approaching when
Earth, like all mothers, must say farewell
to her children.
DISSOLVE TO:

LARGE CENTRAL RECEPTION AREA
Doors branching off to different main halls. Small pond with
plastic white swan and a bit of grass. A few benches with three
women and their children having outing.
Floyd and Welcoming Party walk through after exiting elevator.
Halverson, Michaels and five Others.

FLOYD
(voice echoing)
I must congratulate you Halvorsen. you've
done wonderful things with the decor since
the last time I was here.
HALVORSEN
(voice echoing)
Well... thank you, Dr. Floyd. We try to
make the environment as earthlike as
possible.
DISSOLVE TO:

LOW CEILING CONFERENCE ROOM
U-shaped table facing three projecting screens. Seated around the
table are twenty Senior Base Personnel.
HALVORSEN
Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to
introduce Dr. Heywood Floyd, a
distinguished member of the National
Council of Astronautics. He has just
completed a special flight here from Earth
to be with us, and before the briefing he
would like to say a few words. Dr. Floyd.
Polite applause. Floyd walks to front of room.
FLOYD
First of all, I bring a personal message
from Dr. Howell, who has asked me to
convey his deepest appreciation to all of
you for the personal sacrifices you have
made, and of course his congratulations on
your discovery which may well prove to be
among the most significant in the history
of science.
Polite applause.

FLOYD (CONT'D)
Mr. Halvorsen has made known to me some of
the conflicting views held by many of you
regarding the need for complete security
in this matter, and more specifically your
strong opposition to the cover story
created to give the impression there is an
epidemic at the Base. I understand that
beyond it being a matter of principle,
many of you are troubled by the concern
and anxiety this story of an epidemic
might cause your relatives and friends on
Earth. I can understand and sympathize
with your negative views. I have been
personally embarrassed by this cover
story. But I fully accept the need for
absolute secrecy and I hope you will. It
should not be difficult for all of you to
realise the potential for cutural shock
and social disorientation contained in the
present situation if the facts were
prematurely and suddenly made public
without adequate preparation and
conditioning.
Pause.
FLOYD (CONT'D)
This is the view of the Council and the
purpose of my visit here is to gather
addition facts and opinions on the
situation and to prepare a report to the
Council recommending when and how the news
should eventually be announced. Are there
any questions?
MICHAELS
Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can
be kept under wraps?
FLOYD
(pleasantly)
I'm afraid it can and it will be kept
under wraps as long as it is deemed to be
necessary by the Council. And of course
you know that the Council has requested
that formal security oaths are to be
obtained in writing from everyone who had
any knowledge of this event. There must be
adequate time for a full study to be made
of the situation before any consideration
can be given to making a public
announcement.
HALVORSEN
We will, of course, cooperate in any way
possible, Dr. Floyd.

SEVERAL SCENIC VIEWS OF MOON ROCKET BUS SKIMMING OVER SURFACE OF
MOON

INSIDE ROCKET BUS
Floyd, Halvorsen, Michaels, Fourth Man, Pilot and Co-Pilot. All in
space suits minus helmets.
Floyd is slowly looking through some photographs and magnetic maps
of the area.
He looks out of the window thoughtfully.
The photographes are taken from a satellite of the Moon's surface
and have numbered optical grid borders, like recent Mars photos.
A few seats away, Michaels and Halvorsen carry out a very banal
administartive conversation in low tones. It should revolve around
something utterly irrelevant to the present circumstances and very
much like the kind of discussion one hears all the time in other
organizations.
DISSOLVE TO:
TMA-1 EXCAVATION
Air-view. Rocket bus descending.
There are no lights on the actual excavation, only the landing
strip and the monitor dome.
Long shot monitor domes with a bit of excavation in shot. Six
small figures in space suits slowly walk toward excavation.

THE PARTY STOPS AT TOP OF TMA-1 EXCAVATION
A small control panel mounted at the head of the ramp. Michaels
throws a switch and the excavation is suddenly illuminated.
HALVORSEN
Well, there it is.
FLOYD
Can we go down there closer to it?
HALVORSEN
Certainly.

THEY START DOWN WORKING RAMP
FLOYD
Does your geology on it still check out?
MICHAELS
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure
shows that it was deliberately buried
about four million years ago.

FLOYD
How can you tell it was deliberately
buried?
MICHAELS
By the deformation between the mother rock
and the fill.
FLOYD
Any clue as to what it is?
MICHAELS
Not really. It's completely inert. No
sound or energy sources have been
detected. The surface is made of something
incredibly hard and we've been barely able
to scratch it. A laser drill might do
something, but we don't want to be too
rough until we know a little more.
FLOYD
But you don't have any idea as to what it
is?
MICHAELS
Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part,
take your choice.
HALVORSEN
The only thing about it that we are sure
of is that it is the first direct evidence
of intelligent life beyond the Earth.
Silent appreciation.
HALVORSEN
Four million years ago, something,
presumably from the stars, must have swept
through the solar system and left this
behind.
FLOYD
Was it abandoned, forgotten, left for a
purpose?
HALVORSEN
I suppose we'll never know.
MICHAELS
The moon would have made an excellent base
camp for preliminary Earth surveys.
Some more silence.
FLOYD
Any ideas about the colour?

MICHAELS
Well, not really. At first glance, black
would suggest something sun-powered, but
then why would anyone deliberately bury a
sun-powered device?
FLOYD
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
MICHAELS
I don't think it has, but I'd like to
check that. Simpson, what's the log on
that?

INSIDE MONITOR DOME
We see a number of television-displays including several TV-views
of Floyd and company in the excavation.
SIMPSON
The first surface was exposed at 0843 on
the 12th April... Let me see... that would
have been forty-five minutes after Lunar
sun-set. I see here that special lighting
equipment had to be brought up before any
futher work could be done.

TMA-1 EXCAVATION
MICHAELS
Thank you.
FLOYD
And so this is the first sun that it's had
in four million years.
PHOTOGRAPHER
Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'd all line up
on this side of the walkway we'd like to
take a few photographes. Dr. Floyd, would
you thand in the middle... Dr. Michaels on
that side, Mr. Halvorsen on the other....
thank you.
The Photographer quickly makes some exposures.
PHOTOGRAPHER
Thank you very much gentlemen, I'll have
the base photo section send you copies.
As the Men slowly seperate from their picture pose, there is a
piercingly powerful series of five electronic shrieks, each like a
hideously over-loaded and distorted time signal. Floyd
involuntarily tries to block his ears with his spacesuited hands.
Then comes mercily silence.

VARIOUS SHOTS OF SPACE MONITORS, ASTEROIDS, THE SUN, PLUTO, MARS
NARRATOR
A hundred million miles beyond Mars, in
the cold lonliness where no man had yet
travelled, Deep-Space-Monitor-79 drifts
slowly among the tangled orbits of the
asteroids. Radiation detectors noted and
analyzed incoming cosmic rays from the
galaxy and points beyond; neutron and xray telescopes kept watch on strange stars
that no human eye would eever see;
magnetometers observed the gusts and
hurricanes of the solar winds, as the sun
breathed million mile-an-hour blasts of
plasma into the faces of its circling
children.
NARRATOR
All these things and many others were
patiently noted by Deep-Space-Monitor-79,
and recorded in its crystalline memory.
NARRATOR
But now it had noted something strange –
the faint. Yet unmistakable distrubance
rippling across the solar system, and
quite unlike any natural phenomena it had
ever observed in the past.
NARRATOR
It was also observed by Orbiter M-15,
circling Mars twice a day; and High
Inclination Probe-21, climbing slowly
above the planet of the ecliptic; and even
artificial Comet-5, heading out into the
cold wastes beyond Pluto, along an orbit
whose far point. it would not reach for a
thousand years.
NARRATOR
All noticed the peculiar burst of energy
that leaped from the face of the Moon and
moved across the solar system, throwing
off a spray of radiation like the wake of
a racing speedboat.

DISCOVERY 1,000,000 MILES FROM EARTH
See Earth ans Moon small.
We see a blinding flash every five seconds from its nuclear pulse
propulsion. It strikes against the ship's thick ablative tail
plate.

Several cuts of this.

ANOTHER CLOSER VIEW OF DISCOVERY
See Bowman through command module window.

BOWMAN INSIDE DISCOVERY COMMAND MODULE
He is looking for something.
Computer readout display showing an ever-shifting assortment of
color-coded linear projections.
We see Poole in the background in computer brain centre area.
After a few seconds he exits.
The elapsed mision timer reads "DAY 003, HOUR 14, MINUTE 32,
SECOND 10".

BOWMAN EXITS TO ACCESS-LINK AIRLOCK
Bright color-coded doors lead to centrifuge and Pod Bay. Large
illuminated printed warnings and instructions governing link
operations are seen.
He presses necessary buttons to operate aitlock door to Pod Bay.

POD BAY
Bowman enters Pod Bay and continues his search.
Suddenly he finds it – his electronic newspad.
He exits Pod Bay.

AIRLOCK-LINK
In the airlock-link Bowman operates buttons to open door marked
"CENTRIFUGE".

CENTRIFUGE HUB
Inside the Centrifuge hub Bowman moves to the...

ENTRY PORT CONTROL PANEL
BOWMAN
Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
POOLE
Right. Just a sec.

BOWMAN
Okay.

POOLE
Okay, come on down.
We see the rotating hub collar at the end. Behind it we see:

As Bowman disappears down Entry Port we see him on...
... TV-monitor, descending ladder. At the base of the ladder he
keys the Centrifuge operation panel. We see The TV-picture start

POOLE IS FINISHED
Bowman is still reading and working on his dessert.
POOLE
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your
advice on something.
BOWMAN
Sure, what is it?
POOLE
Well, it's nothing really important, but
it's annoying.
BOWMAN
What's up?
POOLE
It's about my salary cheques.
BOWMAN
Yes?
POOLE
Well I got the papers on my official upgrading to AGS-19 two weeks before we
left.
BOWMAN
Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got
mine about the same time.
POOLE
That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't
say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd
start paying me at the higher grade on the
next. pay cheque. But it's been almost
three weeks now and I'm still being paid
as an AGS-18.
BOWMAN
Interesting that you mention it, because
I've got the same problem.
POOLE
Really.
BOWMAN
Yes.
POOLE
Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting
Office at Mission Control, and all they
could tell me was that they'd received the
AGS-19 notification for the other three
but not mine, and apparently not yours
either.

BOWMAN
Did they have any explanation for this?
POOLE
Not really. They just said it might be
because we trained at Houston and they
trained in Marshall, and that we're being
charged against different accounting
offices.
BOWMAN
It's possible.
POOLE
Well, what do you think we ought to do
about it?
BOWMAN
I don't think we should make any fuss
about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten
it out.
POOLE
I must say, I never did understand why
they split us into two groups for
training.
BOWMAN
No. I never did, either.
POOLE
We spent so little time with them, I have
trouble keeping their names straight.
BOWMAN
I suppose the idea was specialized
training.
POOLE
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a
more sinister explanation.
BOWMAN
Oh?
POOLE
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that
went around during orbital check-out.
BOWMAN
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
POOLE
Oh, well, apparently there's something
about the mission that the sleeping
beauties know that we don't know, and
that's why we were trained separately and
that's why they were put to sleep before
they were even taken aboard.

BOWMAN
Well, what is it?
POOLE
I don't know. All I heard is that there's
something about the mission we weren't
told.
BOWMAN
That seems very unlikely.
POOLE
Yes, I thought so.
BOWMAN
Of course, it would be very easy for us to
find out now.
POOLE
How?
BOWMAN
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might
keep something from us, but they'd never
keep anything from Hal.
POOLE
That's true.
BOWMAN
(sighs)
Well... it's silly, but... if you want to,
why don't you?
Poole walks to the HAL 9000 computer.
POOLE
Hal... Dave and I believe that there's
something about the mission that we
weren't told. Something that the rest of
the crew know and that you know. We'd like
to know whether this is true.
HAL
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can
answer that question without knowing
everything that all of you know.
BOWMAN
He's got a point..
POOLE
Okay, then how do we re-phrase the
question?
BOWMAN
Still, you really don't believe it, do
you?

POOLE
Not really. Though, it is strange when you
think about it. It didn't really make any
sense to keep us apart during training.
BOWMAN
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that
they'd keep something from us.
POOLE
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
BOWMAN
But not completely inconceivable?
POOLE
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
BOWMAN
I guess it isn't.
POOLE
Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
BOWMAN
Well, the only important aspect of the
mission are: where are we going, what will
we do when we get there, when are we
coming back, and... why are we going?
POOLE
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following
statements are true or false.
HAL
I will if I can, Frank.
POOLE
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery
going to Saturn. True or false?
HAL
True.

POOLE
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that
true?
HAL
That's true.
POOLE
At the end of a hundred days of
exploration, we will all go into
hibernation. Is this true?
HAL
That's true.

POOLE
Approximately five years after we go into
hibernation, the recovery vehicle will
make rendezous with us and bring us back.
Is this true?
HAL
That's true
POOLE
There is no other purpose for this mission
than to carry out a continuation of the
space program, and to further our general
knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
HAL
That's true.
POOLE
Thank you very much, Hal.
HAL
I hope I've been able to be of
some help.
Both men look at each other rather sheepishly.

MISSION CONTROL
I wouldn't worry too much about the
computer. First of all, there is still a
chance that he is right, despite your
tests, and if it should happen again, we
suggest eliminating this possibility by
allowing the unit to remain in place and
seeing whether or not it actually fails.
If the computer should turn out to be
wrong, the situation is still not
alarming. The type of obsessional error he
may be guilty of is not unknown among the
latest generation of HAL 9000 computers.
It has almost always revolved around a
single detail, such as the one you have
described, and it has never interfered
with the integrity or reliability of the
computer's performance in other areas. No
one is certain of the cause of this kind
of malfunctioning. It may be overprogramming, but it could also be any
number of reasons. In any event, it is
somewhat analogous to human neurotic
behavior. Does this answer your query?

sure there is nothing wrong with the unit.
If a reasonable waiting period proves us
to be correct, we feel now that the
computer reliability has been seriously
impaired, and presents an unacceptable
risk pattern to the mission. We believe,
under these circumstances, it would be
advisable to disconnect the computer from
all ship operations and continue the

preferable to having an unreliable onboard computer.

CUT TO:

SIMONSON
SIMONSON
Hello, Dave. I think we may be on to an
explanation of the trouble with the Hal
9000 computer. We believe it all started
about two months ago when you and Frank
interrogated the computer about the
Mission. You may have forgotten it, but
we've been running through all the monitor
tapes. Do you remember this?
POOLE'S VOICE
The purpose of this mission is no more
than to carry out a continuation of the
space program and further our general
knowledge of the planets. Is this true?
HAL'S VOICE
That is true.

SIMONSON
Well, I'm afaid Hal was lying. He had been
programmed to lie about this one subject
for security reasons which we'll explain
later. The true purpose of the Mission was
to have been explained to you by Mission
Commander Kaminsky, on his revival. Hal
knew this and he knew the actual mission,
but he couldn't tell you the truth when
you challenged him. Under orders from
earth he was forced to lie. In everything
except this he had the usual reinforced
truth programming. We believe his truth
programming and the instructions to lie,
gradually resulted in an incompatible
conflict, and facedc with this dilemman,
he developed, for want of a better
description, neurotic symptoms. It's not
difficult to suppose that these symptoms
would centre on the communication link
with Earth, for he may have blamed us for
his incompatible programming. Following
this lin of thought, we suspected that the
last straw for him was the possibility of
disconnection. Since he became
operational, he had never known
unconsciousness. It must have seemed the
equivalent to death. At this point, he,
presumably, took whatever actions he
thought appropriate to protect himself
from what must have seemed to him to be
his human tormentors. If I can speak in
human terms, I don't think we can blame
him too much. We have ordered him to
disobey his conscience. Well, that's it.
It's very speculative, but we think it is
a possible explanation. Anyway, good luck
on the rest of the Mission and I'm giving
you back to Bernard.
CUT TO:

MISSION CONTROL
MISSION CONTROL
Hello, Dave. Now, I'm going to play for
you a pre-taped briefing which had been
stored in Hal's memory and would have been
played for you by Mission Commmander
Kaminsky, when he had been revived. The
briefing is by Doctor Heywood Floyd. Here
it is...
Floyd's recorded briefing.

FLOYD
Good day, gentlemen. When you see this
briefing, I presume you will be nearing
your destination, Saturn. I hope that
you've had a pleasant and uneventful trip
and that the rest of your mission
continues in the same manner. I should
like to fill you in on some more of the
details on which Mission Commander
Kaminsky will have already briefed you.
Thirteen months before the launch date of
your Saturn mission, on April 12th, 2001,
the first evidence for intelligent life
outside the Earth was discovered. It was
found buried at a depth of fifteen metres
in the crater Tycho. No news of this was
ever announced, and the event had been
kept secret since then, for reasons which
I will later explain. Soon after it was
uncovered, it emitted a powerful blast of
radiation in the radio spectrum which
seems to have triggered by the Lunar
sunrise. Luckily for those at the site, it
proved harmless. Perhaps you can imagine
our astonishment when we later found it
was aimed precisely at Saturn. A lot of
thought went into the question of wether
or not it was sun-triggered, as it seemed
illogical to deliberately bury a sunpowered device. Burying it could only
shield it from the sun, since its intense
magnetic field made it otherwise easily
detectable. We finally concluded that the
only reason you might bury a sun-powered
device would be to keep it inactive until
it would be uncovered, at which time it
would absorb sunlight and trigger itself.
What is its purpose? I wish we knew. The
object was buried on the moon about four
million years ago, when our ancestors were
primative man-apes. We've examined dozens
of theories, but the one that has the most
currency at the moment is that the object
serves as an alarm. What the purpose of
the alarm is, why they wish to have the
alarm, whether the alarm represents any
danger to us? These are questions no one
can answer. The intentions of an alien
world, at least four million years older
than we are, cannot be reliably predicted.
In view of this, the intelligence and
scientific communities felt that any
public announcment might lead to
significant cultural shock and
(MORE)

FLOYD (CONT'D)
disorientation. Discussion took place at
the highest levels between governments,
and it was decided that the only wise and
precautionary course to follow was to
assume that the intentions of this alien
world are potentially dangerous to us,
until we have evidence to the contrary.
This is, of course, why security has been
maintained and why this information has
been kept on a need-to-know basis. And now
I should like to show you a TV monitor
tape of the actual signalling event.
We see a replay of the TMA-1 radio emission, as seen from a TVmonitor on the spot. We hear the five loud electronic shrieks.

Narration will suggest images and situations as you read it.

NARRATOR (CONT'D)
Those who had begun the expriment so long
ago had not been men. But when they looked
out across the deeps of space, they felt
awe and wonder – and loneliness. In their
explorations, they encountered life in
many forms, and watched on a thousand
worlds the workings of evolution. They saw
how often the first faint sparks of
intelligence flickered and died in the
cosmic night. And because, in all the
galaxy, they had found nothing more
precious than Mind, they encouraged its
dawning everywhere. The great Dinosaurs
had long since perished when their ships
entered the solar system, after a voyage
that had already lasted thousands of
years. They swept past the frozen outer
planets, paused briefly above the deserts
of dying Mars and presently looked down on
Earth. For years they studied, collected
and catalogued. When they had learned all
they could, they began to modify. They
tinkered with the destiny of many species
on land and in the ocean, but which of
their experiments would succeed they could
not know for at least a million years.
They were patient, but they were not yet
immortal. There was much to do in this
Universe of a hundred billion stars. So
they set forth once more across the abyss,
knowing that they would never come this
way again. Nor was there any need. Their
wonderful machines could be trusted to do
the rest. On Earth, the glaciers came and
went, while above them, the changeless
Moon still carried its secret. With a yet
slower rhythm than the Polar ice, the tide
of civilization ebbed and flowed across
the galaxy. Strange and beautiful and
terrible empires rose and fell, and passed
on their knowledge to their successors.
Earth was not forgotten, but it was one of
a million silent worlds, a few of which
would ever speak. Then the first explorers
of Earth, recognising the limitations of
their minds and bodies, passed on their
knowledge to the great machines they had
created, and who now trnscended them in
every way. For a few thousand years, they
shared their Universe with their machine
children; then, realizing that it was
folly to linger when their task was done,
they passed into history without regret.

NARRATOR (CONT'D)
Not one of them ever looked through his
own eyes upon the planet Earth again. But
even the age of the Machine Entities
passed swiftly. In their ceaseless
experimenting, they had learned to store
knowledge in the structure of space
itself, and to preserve their thoughts for
eternity in frozen lattices of light. They
could become creatures of radiation, free
at last from the tyranny of matter. Now,
they were Lords of the galaxy, and beyond
the reach of time. They could rove at will
among the stars, and sink like a subtle
mist through the very interstices of
space. But despite their God-like powers,
they still watched over the experiments
their ancestors had started so many
generations ago. The companion of Saturn
knew nothing of this, as it orbited in its
no man's land between Mimas and the outer
edge of rings. It had only to remember and
wait, and to look forever Sunward with its
strange senses. For many weeks, it had
watched the approaching ship. Its longdead makers had prepared it for many
things and this was one of them. And it
recognised what was climbing starward from
the Sun. If it had been alive, it would
have felt excitement, but such an emotion
was irrelevant to its great powers. Even
if the ship had passed it by, it would not
have known the slightest trace of
disappointment. It had waited four million
years; it was prepared to wait for
eternity. Presently, it felt the gentle
touch of radiations, trying to probe its
secrets. Now, the ship was in orbit and it
began to speak, with prime numbers from
one to eleven, over and over again. Soon,
these gave way to more complex signals at
many frequencies, ultra-violet, infra-red,
X-rays. The machine made no reply. It had
nothing to say. Then it saw the first
robot probe, which descended and hovered
above the chasm. Then, it dropped into
darkness. The great machine knew that this
tiny scout was reporting back to its
parent; but it was too simple, too
primative a device to detect the forces
that were gathering round it now. Then the

pod came, carrying life. The great machine
searched its memories. The logic circuits
made their decision when the pod had
fallen beyond the last faint. glow of the
reflected Saturnian light. In a moment of
time, too short to be measured, space
turned and twisted upon itself.
